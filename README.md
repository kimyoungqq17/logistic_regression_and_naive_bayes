# logistic_regression_and_naive_bayes

## Comparing performances of different models using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
### Task: Address the performance of the two methods on four different datasets.
* dataset was pre processed
* the data was split into test and train datasets and the occurrence of classes was derived
* meaningful data has been plotted to see potential dependencies
* the model for both logistic regression and naive bayes were trained for all four datasets
* the predicted outcome of the model was obtained from the test datasets and compared to
the actual test target values
* the naive bayes and the logistic repression were compared in several parameters such as 
their accuracy and performance speed
